            <p id="home-para">
                To predict life expectancy based on lifestyle and ways to increase life expectancy.
            </p>
            <h1 class="heading"><span>WHY CALCULATE ONE'S LIFE EXPECTANCY?</span></h1>
            <p id="home-para">Some people find the concept of life expectancy calculator to be offensive.
                However, there are many reasons other than morbid curiosity for wanting to determine approximately how
                long one has to live.

            <p id="home-para">For example, if an individual is terminally ill or has a progressive condition such as
                Alzheimer’s and they require long term care, their family will want them to live out their days
                in an
                environment where they are most comfortable. Knowing approximately how long care will be
                required will
                help the family make the decision whether they can afford to pay for Alzheimer’s care or whether
                they’ll
                need to qualify for Medicaid. One decision might be made with a life expectancy of 6 months and
                an
                entirely different decision with a life expectancy of several years. This is especially relevant
                when it
                comes to paying for long term care using financial products such as reverse mortgages that have
                high
                upfront costs.</p>

            <h1 class="heading"><span>ABOUT THIS TOOL</span></h1>
            <div>
                <p id="home-para">The Life Expectancy Tool is based on a statistical analysis project led by Dr. Sabina
                    Priyadarshini at Birla Institute of Technology , Mesra , Ranchi. The Tool is based on self collected
                    dataset of approximately 115 dead people in India ; mostly in the state of Jharkhand. The data was
                    received in response to build a curated dataset for the project in hand. The data is anonymized for
                    research purposes. Survey participants responded on behalf of their dead family members which
                    included questions like medical history ,diet , health,lifestyle , etc. The date of their death, was
                    also recorded.</p>

                <p id="home-para">Almost 500 people were sent surveys. The cohort consisted of 300 respondents. After
                    cleaning the data (by removing respondents with extreme values of height, weight, caloric
                    consumption, alcohol consumption,etc.), there were 200 survey responses left. Respondents whose
                    dates of death were the same day as their reported survey responses were then removed.Further we
                    removed the data of respondents who did not report currently having any chronic disease at the time
                    of the survey, which left us with 113 total respondents. Of these, 67.3% were men and 32.7% were
                    women.</p>

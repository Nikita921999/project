                To predict life expectancy based on lifestyle and ways to increase life expectancy.

            <h1 class="heading"><span>WHY CALCULATE ONE'S LIFE EXPECTANCY?</span></h1>
            <p id="home-para">Some people find the concept of life expectancy calculator to be offensive.
                However, there
                are many reasons other than morbid curiosity for wanting to determine approximately how long one
                has to
                live.

            <p id="home-para">For example, if an individual is terminally ill or has a progressive condition
                such as
                Alzheimer’s and they require long term care, their family will want them to live out their days
                in an
                environment where they are most comfortable. Knowing approximately how long care will be
                required will
                help the family make the decision whether they can afford to pay for Alzheimer’s care or whether
                they’ll
                need to qualify for Medicaid. One decision might be made with a life expectancy of 6 months and
                an
                entirely different decision with a life expectancy of several years. This is especially relevant
                when it
                comes to paying for long term care using financial products such as reverse mortgages that have
                high
                upfront costs.</p>
